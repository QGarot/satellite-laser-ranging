# :satellite: Context
Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) allows the precise measurement of long distances by determining the round-trip travel time of a light pulse between a ground station and a satellite.
SLR plays a key role in several fields of Earth and space science.
Indeed, orbit measurements are used to better understand the distribution of Earthâ€™s mass, tectonic plate motion or ocean circulation patterns.
This project focuses on the use of SLR for satellite orbit control, illustrating how laser measurements can be used to validate the theoretical trajectory of a satellite.
